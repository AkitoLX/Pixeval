# Pixeval.CommunityToolkit Namespace
The components contained in this namespace is copied from [CommunityTookkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/tree/winui) as is. Since the official repository still insist on `Microsoft.ProjectReunion` instead of Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK, we cannot use the WCTK for now, however, the changes that required to be done are just some simple name and dependency substitutions and won't affect the internal logic of the code, so I just simply copy and paste them here for developing purpose, this namespace will be deleted as soon as the offcial release of the WCTK for the Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK
